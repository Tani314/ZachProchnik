                <p>
                    Working as a paramedic during this tragedy left me with a lot to process and without any structure to turn to.
                    So I started creating paintings with what materials I found lying around, many soon to be trash.
                    Newspapers, magazines, broken door knobs, pallets of wood, plastic bags, or whatever other odds and ends I found interesting.
                    I soon discovered that breathing life into these forgotten objects gave me comfort.
                    I was helpless as I watched Covid leave so many gasping for air in a world that was either indifferent or incompetent.
                    My work to help others through EMS fell victim to faulty systems and I found myself as a frontline witness to this disaster.
                    I donâ€™t know what role art can play in fixing our broken society but I know creating it helped me feel less broken.
                    I welcome all to come, heal, and celebrate life together with me.
              </p>
